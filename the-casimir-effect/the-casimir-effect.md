# The Casimir effect

The Hamiltonian for a free scalar field is

$$
H = \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} \omega_k \left(a_k^\dagger a_k + \frac12\right)~,
$$

So the contribution to the vacuum energy of the zero modes is

$$
E = \langle 0 | H | 0 \rangle = \int \frac{d^3 k }{(2\pi)^3 } \frac{\omega_k}{2} = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2} \int k^3 dk = \infty~,
$$

known as the **zero-point energy**.
