# Regulator-independent derivation

Casimir showed in his [original paper ](https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf)a way to calculate the force in a regulator-independent way. Define the energy as

$$
E(a) = \frac \pi 2 \sum_n \frac n a f\left(\frac{n}{a\Lambda}\right)~,
$$

where $$f(x)$$ is some function whose properties we will determine shortly.
