# Regulator independence

You should find the calculation of the Casimir effect incredibly disconcerting. We found the force to be independent of $$\Lambda$$, but we needed to use a crazy model of the walls where the discreteness of the hard cutoff played an important role.

It turns out that even if we took a different model besides the hard cutoff for regulating the UV modes, we get the same answer, as long as the cutoff satisfies some basic requirements.
